# Auth Template

This is a template for next.js which will help me get started on new projects. Auth is set up and working with google. All which needs to be provided are the correct env values.

## ENV Values (aka: Quick Start)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...

GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
```

Supabase keys can be found on their site.

Google OAuth can be found on the dev console for tkirpaul@gmail.com.

The Next Auth values are easier, the URL is the url of the running client. The secret can be anything at this point, since we have not deployed.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
